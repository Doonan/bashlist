Thank you for checking out my project, 'bashlist.sh'!!!

This script maintains a list for you and control of that list is done in the terminal.

Options for the script can be read up on in the code itself, or by running the script with the argument -h or --help,

The idea is for a user to have a terminal window open with the list on it, kind of like a to-do list.
It is manipulated by calling the script name or an alias with whatever option you want and the list updates in that terminal window - bam!

The sed command used in the script is set up to work on a mac, so no guarantees it will work on any other os.

All I had to do to set up the script is add the directory the script will live in to my PATH variable and it should work.
